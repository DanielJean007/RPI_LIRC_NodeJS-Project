# RPI_LIRC_NodeJS-Project
This projects records the remote control command in order to bean them back from a local hardware set up on a RPI.

This setup can be accessed from anywhere via a Internet enable device

# Necessary hardware to run this project
1 - Raspberry Pi board. This project was developed on a RPI-1B board.

2 - Infra-Red sensor. (Emitter and receiver.)

3 - Dongle wifi.

# Necessary software to run this project
1 - LIRC library

2 - NodeJS

3 - lirc_web project

4 - localtunnel or ngrok

# Where to find help for setting up things
  Set up LIRC lib on RPI:

# What do do after following all the above steps?
  1 - Moving files around:

    Move the folders 'db/', 'views/' and the file 'app.js' to the folder 'lirc_web'.

    This will change the behaviour of the website where we can access the remote controls. First, we added a login area. Since we'll be tunneling our local server, it's NOT interesting the everyone with the link could access the devices in our house. It's better if ONLY people with username and password could to it.

    To add a new user and password open the file users.js under the folder 'db/'. Just follow the structure under 'var records'. To test the web server type:
        username: batman
        password: robin

    Another change is that we'll be using port 80, instead of 3000.
